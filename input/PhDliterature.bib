abstract = {Imagine that you are blindfolded inside an unknown room. You snap your fingers and listen to the room's response. Can you hear the shape of the room? Some people can do it naturally, but can we design computer algorithms that hear rooms? We show how to compute the shape of a convex polyhedral room from its response to a known sound, recorded by a few microphones. Geometric relationships between the arrival times of echoes enable us to "blindfoldedly" estimate the room geometry. This is achieved by exploiting the properties of Euclidean distance matrices. Furthermore, we show that under mild conditions, first-order echoes provide a unique description of convex polyhedral rooms. Our algorithm starts from the recorded impulse responses and proceeds by learning the correct assignment of echoes to walls. In contrast to earlier methods, the proposed algorithm reconstructs the full 3D geometry of the room from a single sound emission, and with an arbitrary geometry of the microphone array. As long as the microphones can hear the echoes, we can position them as we want. Besides answering a basic question about the inverse problem of room acoustics, our results find applications in areas such as architectural acoustics, indoor localization, virtual reality, and audio forensics.},

abstract = {We consider inference in a general data-driven object-based model of multichannel audio data, assumed generated as a possibly under-determined convolutive mixture of source signals. Each source is given a model inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito divergence, which underlies a statistical model of superimposed Gaussian components. We address estimation of the mixing and source parameters using two methods. The first one consists of maximizing the exact joint likelihood of the multichannel data using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The second method consists of maximizing the sum of individual likelihoods of all channels using a multiplicative update algorithm inspired from NMF methodology. Our decomposition algorithms were applied to stereo music and assessed in terms of blind source separation performance.},

abstract = {In this work we address the problem of approximating high-dimensional data with a low-dimensional representation. We make the following contributions. We propose an inverse regression method which exchanges the roles of input and response, such that the low-dimensional variable becomes the regressor, and which is tractable. We introduce a mixture of locally-linear probabilistic mapping model that starts with estimating the parameters of inverse regression, and follows with inferring closed-form solutions for the forward parameters of the high-dimensional regression problem of interest. Moreover, we introduce a partially-latent paradigm, such that the vector-valued response variable is composed of both observed and latent entries, thus being able to deal with data contaminated by experimental artifacts that cannot be explained with noise models. The proposed probabilistic formulation could be viewed as a latent-variable augmentation of regression. We devise expectation-maximization (EM) procedures based on a data augmentation strategy which facilitates the maximum-likelihood search over the model parameters. We propose two augmentation schemes and we describe in detail the associated EM inference procedures that may well be viewed as generalizations of a number of EM regression, dimension reduction, and factor analysis algorithms. The proposed framework is validated with both synthetic and real data. We provide experimental evidence that our method outperforms several existing regression techniques.},

abstract = {Sparse data models are powerful tools for solving ill-posed inverse problems. We present a regularization framework based on the sparse synthesis and sparse analysis models for problems governed by linear partial differential equations. Although nominally equivalent, we show that the two models differ substantially from a computational perspective: unlike the sparse synthesis model, its analysis counterpart has much better scaling capabilities and can indeed be faster when more measurement data is available. Our findings are illustrated on two examples, sound source localization and brain source localization, which also serve as showcases for the regularization framework. To address this type of inverse problems, we develop a specially tailored convex optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problems of modeling the acoustic space generated by a full-spectrum sound source and using the learned model for the localization and separation of multiple sources that simultaneously emit sparse-spectrum sounds. We lay theoretical and methodological grounds in order to introduce the binaural manifold paradigm. We perform an in-depth study of the latent low-dimensional structure of the high-dimensional interaural spectral data, based on a corpus recorded with a human-like audiomotor robot head. A nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique is used to show that these data lie on a two-dimensional (2D) smooth manifold parameterized by the motor states of the listener, or equivalently, the sound-source directions. We propose a probabilistic piecewise affine mapping model (PPAM) specifically designed to deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting an intrinsic piecewise linear structure. We derive a closed-form expectation-maximization (EM) procedure for estimating the model parameters, followed by Bayes inversion for obtaining the full posterior density function of a sound-source direction. We extend this solution to deal with missing data and redundancy in real-world spectrograms, and hence for 2D localization of natural sound sources such as speech. We further generalize the model to the challenging case of multiple sound sources and we propose a variational EM framework. The associated algorithm, referred to as variational EM for source separation and localization (VESSL) yields a Bayesian estimation of the 2D locations and time-frequency masks of all the sources. Comparisons of the proposed approach with several existing methods reveal that the combination of acoustic-space learning with Bayesian inference enables our method to outperform state-of-the-art methods. {\textcopyright} 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Existing sound source localization methods are either based on an approximate physical model (physics-driven) or on a specific-purpose calibration set (data-driven). With VAST, the idea is to learn a mapping from audio features to desired audio properties using a massive dataset of simulated room impulse re-sponses. This virtual dataset is designed to be maximally representative of the potential audio scenes that the considered system may be evolving in, while remaining reasonably compact. We show that virtually-learned mappings on this dataset generalize to real data, overcoming some intrin-sic limitations of traditional binaural sound localization methods based on time differences of arrival.},

An acoustic shoe-box room simulator is used to generate a large number of binaural single-source audio scenes. These scenes are used to build a dataset of spatial binaural features annotated with acoustic properties such as the 3D source po-sition and the walls' absorption coefficients. A probabilis-tic high-to low-dimensional regression framework is used to learn a mapping from these features to the acoustic properties. Results indicate that this mapping successfully estimates the azimuth and elevation of new sources, but also their range and even the walls' absorption coefficients solely based on binau-ral signals.

We first prove that such a generalization is not possible using a single multichannel spectro-temporal observation, regardless of the number of microphones. We then introduce a new transform for multichannel multi-frame spectrograms, i.e., containing several channels and time frames in each time-frequency bin. This transform allows a natural generalization which satisfies the three key properties of RTFs, namely, they can be directly estimated from observed signals, they capture spatial properties of the sources and they do not depend on emitted signals. Through simulated experiments, we show how this new method can localize multiple simultaneously active sound sources using short spectro-temporal windows, without relying on source separation.},

While different ag-gregation schemes exist, they are often heuristic and suffer in adverse noise conditions. In this paper, we introduce the rectified binaural ratio as a new feature for sound source local-ization. We show that for Gaussian-process point source signals corrupted by stationary Gaussian noise, this ratio follows a complex t-distribution with explicit parameters. This new formulation provides a principled and statistically sound way to aggregate binaural features in the presence of noise. We subsequently derive two simple and efficient methods for robust relative transfer function and time-delay estimation. Experiments on heavily corrupted simulated and speech signals demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {The problem of source localization with ad hoc microphone networks in noisy and reverberant enclosures, given a training set of prerecorded measurements, is addressed in this paper. The training set is assumed to consist of a limited number of labelled measurements, attached with corresponding positions, and a larger amount of unlabelled measurements from unknown locations. However, microphone calibration is not required. We use a Bayesian inference approach for estimating a function that maps measurement-based feature vectors to the corresponding positions. The central issue is how to combine the information provided by the different microphones in a unified statistical framework. To address this challenge, we model this function using a Gaussian process with a covariance function that encapsulates both the connections between pairs of microphones and the relations among the samples in the training set. The parameters of the process are estimated by optimizing a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. In addition, a recursive adaptation mechanism is derived where the new streaming measurements are used to update the model. Performance is demonstrated for 2-D localization of both simulated data and real-life recordings in a variety of reverberation and noise levels.},
